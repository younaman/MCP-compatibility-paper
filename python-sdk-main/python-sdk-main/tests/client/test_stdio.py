    Tests for child process cleanup functionality using _terminate_process_tree.

    These tests verify that child processes are properly terminated when the parent
    is killed, addressing the issue where processes like npx spawn child processes
    that need to be cleaned up. The tests cover various process tree scenarios:

    - Basic parent-child relationship (single child process)
    - Multi-level process trees (parent → child → grandchild)
    - Race conditions where parent exits during cleanup

    Note on Windows ResourceWarning:
    On Windows, we may see ResourceWarning about subprocess still running. This is
    expected behavior due to how Windows process termination works:
    - anyio's process.terminate() calls Windows TerminateProcess() API
    - TerminateProcess() immediately kills the process without allowing cleanup
    - subprocess.Popen objects in the killed process can't run their cleanup code
    - Python detects this during garbage collection and issues a ResourceWarning

    This warning does NOT indicate a process leak - the processes are properly
    terminated. It only means the Popen objects couldn't clean up gracefully.
    This is a fundamental difference between Windows and Unix process termination.
