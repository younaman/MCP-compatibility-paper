Regression test for issue #1027: Ensure cleanup procedures run properly during shutdown

Issue #1027 reported that cleanup code after "yield" in lifespan was unreachable when
processes were terminated. This has been fixed by implementing the MCP spec-compliant
stdio shutdown sequence that closes stdin first, allowing graceful exit.

These tests verify the fix continues to work correctly across all platforms.

    Note on Windows ResourceWarning:
    On Windows, we may see ResourceWarning about unclosed file descriptors.
    This is expected behavior because:
    - We're manually managing the process lifecycle
    - Windows file handle cleanup works differently than Unix
    - The warning doesn't indicate a real issue - cleanup still works
    We filter this warning on Windows only to avoid test noise.
